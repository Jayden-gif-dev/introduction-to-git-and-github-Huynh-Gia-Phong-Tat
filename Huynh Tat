Hi,

So I don't know if this is the way to do it but he said to try your best so here I am.

I'm clueless when it comes to github.
I don't know how to do most thing in here.

I think I've connected my Github with Visual Studios since I can open a repo here.

#ATTEMPT 1
include <iostream>
using namespace std

int main(){
cout << "Hello World?";
return 0;
}
